Testing your mini app before launch ensures it functions correctly, displays properly, and provides the user experience you intended. You can test your app using a few different methods, each suited for different stages of development and testing needs. The only requirement is to have your mini app publicly accessible URL via `https://`.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Base Build Preview Tool">

    Preview and debug your mini app to ensure it displays correctly in the Base App using the [Preview Tool.](https://www.base.dev/preview)

    **Best for:** 

    * Validating correctness of manifest files and required fields
    * Using an interactive console for viewing logs 
    * Signing your app's manifest  
    
    **Not ideal for testing:**
    * Full look and feel on your app in Base app
    * Chat and Base app specific functionality
    * User context functionality

    **Steps:**

    1. Navigate to [Base.dev/preview](https://www.base.dev/preview)
