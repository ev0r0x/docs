title: "dataSuffix"
description: "Append arbitrary data to transaction calldata for attribution tracking"
---

Defined in [ERC-8021](https://eip.tools/eip/8021)

<Info>
The dataSuffix capability allows apps to append arbitrary hex-encoded bytes to transaction calldata. This enables attribution tracking, allowing platforms to identify which app originated a transaction and distribute rewards accordingly.
</Info>

## Parameters

<ParamField body="value" type="`0x${string}`" required>
Hex-encoded bytes to append to the transaction calldata. This value is appended to the end of the calldata for each call in the batch.
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="optional" type="boolean">
When `true`, the wallet may ignore the capability if it doesn't support it. When `false` or omitted, the wallet must support the capability or reject the request.
</ParamField>

## Type Definition

```typescript
type DataSuffixCapability = {
  value: `0x${string}`;
  optional?: boolean;
}
```

## Example Usage

```typescript Example
const result = await provider.request({
  method: "wallet_sendCalls",
  params: [{
    version: "1.0",
    chainId: "0x2105", // Base mainnet
    from: userAddress,
    calls: [
      {
        to: contractAddress,
        value: "0x0",
        data: encodedFunctionCall
      }
    ],
    capabilities: {
      dataSuffix: {
        value: "0x1234567890abcdef1234567890abcdef", // Your attribution suffix
        optional: true // Wallet can proceed even if it doesn't support dataSuffix
      }
    }
  }]
});
```

## Primary Use Case: Builder Codes

The primary use case for `dataSuffix` is [Builder Codes](/base-chain/quickstart/builder-codes) attribution. Builder Codes are unique identifiers that allow apps to receive attribution for onchain activity they generate.

When you register on [base.dev](https://base.dev), you receive a Builder Code that can be encoded as a `dataSuffix`.

```typescript
// Example: Using Builder Code with dataSuffix
const builderCodeSuffix = "0x..."; // Provided by base.dev

await provider.request({
  method: "wallet_sendCalls",
  params: [{
    version: "1.0",
    chainId: "0x2105",
    from: userAddress,
    calls: [{
      to: contractAddress,
      value: "0x0",
      data: swapCallData
    }],
    capabilities: {
      dataSuffix: {
        value: builderCodeSuffix
      }
    }
  }]
});
```

For complete Builder Codes integration instructions, see the [Builder Codes guide](/base-chain/quickstart/builder-codes).

## How It Works

When a wallet receives a `dataSuffix` capability, the suffix is appended to `userOp.callData`. The suffix bytes are concatenated directly to the end of the calldata, making them available for onchain parsing and attribution.

## Best Practices

1. **Use with Builder Codes**: Register on [base.dev](https://base.dev) to get your Builder Code for proper attribution
2. **Set optional appropriately**: Use `optional: true` if your app can function without attribution tracking
3. **Keep suffixes small**: Larger suffixes increase gas costs
